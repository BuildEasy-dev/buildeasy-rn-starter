- **Build & Deploy**: [Expo EAS](https://docs.expo.dev/eas/)
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server**

   ```bash
   pnpm start
   ```

3. **Run on your platform**

   In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a:

   - [Development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/) - Full featured development app
   - [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/) - Run on Android Virtual Device
   - [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/) - Run on iOS Simulator (macOS only)
   - [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) - Limited sandbox for quick testing

   Or use these commands:

   ```bash
   pnpm ios      # iOS simulator
   pnpm android  # Android emulator
   pnpm web      # Web browser
   ```

## Project Structure

```
app/              # Application screens (file-based routing)
  (tabs)/         # Tab navigation screens
  _layout.tsx     # Root layout with providers
components/       # Reusable components
  ui/            # UI components (Tamagui-based)
constants/       # App constants
hooks/          # Custom React hooks
lib/            # Utilities and configurations
  api/          # API client setup
  auth/         # Authentication logic

```

This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction) - start developing by editing files inside the **app** directory.

## AI Development Guidelines

This project includes a `CLAUDE.md` file with specific instructions for AI assistants. Key principles:

- Clear component patterns with TypeScript
- Consistent file naming and structure
- Comprehensive documentation in code
- Predictable state management patterns
- Themed components with light/dark support

## Available Scripts

- `pnpm start` - Start Expo development server
- `pnpm android` - Run on Android
- `pnpm ios` - Run on iOS
- `pnpm web` - Run on web
- `pnpm lint` - Run ESLint
- `pnpm storybook` - Launch Storybook
- `pnpm reset-project` - Reset to blank template (moves starter code to app-example/)
